### Objective

The CT PPP Project studies the Payment Protection Program (PPP) in Connecticut. The goals of this
research include:

* informing policy related to the PPP and other programs for Connecticut small business.
* helping Connecticut residents better understand the scope of PPP lending in the state.
* providing useful data and analysis that can assist other COVID-19-related research.
* supporting Connecticut journalists and local news organizations reporting on the PPP.
